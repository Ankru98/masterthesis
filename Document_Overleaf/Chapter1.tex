\section{Introduction}
The main text forms the actual content of your work. It usually begins with an introduction in which you catch the reader's interest, present the topic, the problem and the aim of your work. In bachelor’s and master’s theses you should also summarize the most important results.\\
Use paragraphs to divide the body text within the (sub) chapters into meaningful sections.
