\section{Second chapter of main text}

The main text can consist of several chapters, sections and subsections.\\
Use paragraphs to divide the body text within the (sub) chapters into mean-ingful sections. Paragraphs that are longer than one page are usually too long. The reader will not remember upon reaching the end of the paragraph what the main message was. On the other hand, a paragraph that consists of only one sentence is likely too short.\\
If you include illustrations, tables and / or equations in the text, explain them to the reader and describe the results in the text. When using symbols in the text, include their meaning (for example, the money stock M).
