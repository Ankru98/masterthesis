# Masterthesis

This repository contains the data and jupyter notebooks created for my masterthesis at Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t zu Kiel with the topic "Optimal Portfolio Building using Machine Learning Techniques".

It is structured as following:

###### 00 - Data sourced from Refinitiv Eikon, containing the price index values of the STOXX Europe 600 and its sector indices from 1986 to 2022.
###### 1 - EDA, containing the step for data preprocessing
###### 2 - containing the data for the shrinkage methods
###### 3 - containing the data for the dimensionality reduction methods
###### 4 - containing the data for the nonlinear ML methods
###### 5 - containing the data for the combination methods
###### 99 - contains extra code especially everything applied for the hyperparameter tuning

The code works when all prerequisites for individual packages are fulfilled.
